          The Villa was designed in 2012 for the family of Anuradha & Narayan
          Raju, their children â€“ Anirudh and Neha, and his mother, in Bangalore.
          The main aim was to make all spaces function to the maximum and to be
          visually pleasing, where some spaces will be simplistic and well
          organized, others delightfully inspiring. Overall, the Design, a
          delightful house with spaces that convert from private cozy scales to
          large spaces to host big gatherings. A play of textures and volumes
          are woven by an interesting composition of light to create and ever
          changing habitat inspired by the clients lifestyle.

          The drama of the house begins from the entrance with a column free
          porch with an expansive landscaping divided by the automatic rolling
          doors of the garage and a lift to the main lobby. The garage has
          movable and openable partitions so the ground floor can house 4-6 of
          the client's high end cars or double as a party hall of 300 capacity
          spilling out into the garden. The soft textures and the use of greens
          to enhance the quality of the space helps create a connect to the
          interiors thereby blurring the lines between the closed and open
          areas.
